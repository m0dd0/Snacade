# Snacade
This addin allows you to play the famous snake game within Fusion360.
Its made to entertain you :)
All the blocks and and spheres, representing the snake or the maze, are
real Fusion360 bodies which are created in the CAD model.

## Settings
### Maze
Their are different mazes to choose from. They contain different kind of obstacles. 
Some of them have "portal" borders, some have fixed borders.

### Block Size
Specifies the diameter of the spheres building up the snake and the side length blocks
representing the maze. This is only important if you keep the bodies and plan to
use them somehow in your CAD model.

### Keep Blocks
If this option is set all the bodies you can see while playing snacade are kept
in a new component after leaving the game.

### Speed
Determines how fast the snake is moving. Please note that Fusion360 is not a game engine
(oviously ;)) so the movement of the snake might become sturdy at high speeds.

## Highscores
The best scores you achieved so far. You get one point per apple your snake ate during a game.
The speed or the maze is not accounted for calculating your score.
